# TJLanguageUtil39

Founded 2024-01-29, even though I already have
similar libraries in other places.

See http://www.nuke24.net/docs/2024/TOGoSJavaLibs.html for guidance
on making and using my Java libraries.

## Building

`mvn install` should do the job.

## Installing

There's no Maven repo to install from.
Get the JAR file and install it into your ~/.m2/repository manually.
